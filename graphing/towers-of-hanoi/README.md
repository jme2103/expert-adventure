# Towers of Hanoi

This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The game consists of three pegs and a number of disks of different sizes that can slide onto any peg. The objective is to move the entire stack of disks from one peg to another, following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty peg.
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Project Structure

- `src/index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the Towers of Hanoi applet.
- `src/styles.css`: Contains the styles for the applet, defining the appearance of the pegs and disks.
- `src/app.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the game, including functions to initialize the game and manage disk movements.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts.
